        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Mapo Tofu is a traditional dish from the Szechuan region in China. Its main ingredients are a fermented chili and bean paste, from which it derives its characteristic red color,
            as well as Tofu chunks.</p>
        <p>It tastes savoury, spicy and should be lightly numbing from the added szechuan pepper. While this specific preparation might not be fully traditional
            it is how I cook and enjoy it every week.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h5>serves 2 people</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tsp black szechuan pepper corn (whole)</li>
            <li>2 green onion (chopped, separate some of the greens for serving)</li>
            <li>roughly 150g of mixed ground meat (pork and beef)</li>
            <li>1 tsp of grated ginger</li>
            <li>1 tsp of soy sauce</li>
            <li>3 tbsp of Doubanjiang</li>
            <li>1 cup of stock or water</li>
            <li>1 tsp of chili oil (or chili crisp)</li>
            <li>1 tsp of sugar</li>
            <li>1 block (~400g) of firm/extra-firm silken tofu (cut into even cubes of your preferred size)</li>
            <li>3 tbsp of cooking oil (vegetable or peanut)</li>
            <li>2 tsp of corn starch (slurried with cold water)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a dry wok, slowly bring the pepper corns up to heat. They should start lightly smoking and releasing their aroma
                but not smell burnt. Remove them and grind them in a spice mill or mortar and pestle.</li>
            <li>Add your soy sauce and ginger to your ground meat and combine.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat to high and add your cooking oil to the wok followed by your ground meat mixture.</li>
            <li>When your meat has browned completely add your Doubanjiang to the wok and let it stir fry for about 2 minutes. 
                The cooking oil should take on a deep red hue.</li>
            <li>Turn down the heat a bit then add your spring onions to the wok and stir fry for another 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn down the heat to medium-low then add your chili oil, the ground szechuan pepper corns, sugar and your stock.</li>
            <li>Slowly stir while it comes back up to heat and dissolve anything that sticks to the bottom of your wok</li>
            <li>Carefully add your tofu cubes to the broth and avoid stirring as to keep the integrity of the tofu.</li>
            <li>Let the mixture simmer for about 10 minutes. If it boils too strong turn down the heat, since you don't want to cook off too much of the broth.</li>
            <li>Slowly add in the corn starch slurry bit by bit and gently stir to avoid clumps.</li>
            <li>Serve with a little bit of the spring onion greens finely chopped on top and a portion of plain white rice on the side.</li>
            <li><em>Enjoy!</em></li>
        </ol>
