        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Mapo Tofu is a traditional dish from the Szechuan region in China. Its main ingredients are a fermented chili and bean paste, from which it derives its characteristic red color,
            as well as Tofu chunks.</p>
        <p>It tastes savoury, spicy and should be lightly numbing from the added szechuan pepper. While this specific preparation might not be fully traditional
            it is how I cook and enjoy it every week.
