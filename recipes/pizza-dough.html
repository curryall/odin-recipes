        <h1>Pizza dough</h1>
        
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Make pizza dough with rapid-rise yeast instead of buying pre-made dough at the grocery store. It's quick and easy to make from scratch, and it tastes better too.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flower, or as needed</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp of salt</li>
            <li>1 envelope of dried yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup very warm water (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp of olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine 2 cups flour, salt, and yeast in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Stir in very warm water and oil until combined, then stir in just enough of remaining 1/2 cup flour to make a soft dough.</li>
            <li>Knead on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Lightly oil your selected pan(s) and sprinkle with cornmeal. Shape dough into a smooth ball, then divide (if necessary) and roll to fit pan(s). </li>
            <li>Top pizza as desired.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown and cheese is melted, 20 to 30 minutes; baking time will depend on the size and thickness of the crust and the amount of toppings.</li>
        </ol>
